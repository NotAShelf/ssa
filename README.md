    Pretty and simple aggregator for the security report generated by

## Usage

There are three possible arguments, two of which are mandatory:

- `--top-n` -> Number of services to list for a given predicate
- `--predicate` -> Predicate for which to aggregate services

### Example:

```bash
systemdeez --top-n 10 --predicate UNSAFE
```

This will return the **10** services marked as **UNSAFE** in the security
report. Possible predicates are:

- "OK"
- "MEDIUM"
- "EXPOSED"
- "UNSAFE"

In addition, you will be shown the average exposure (out of 10) and the average
happiness (out of 5).

## Contributing

For what it's worth, Systemdeez has been created because I wanted to write a
structured bash script for the output of `systemd-analyze security`. Rust came
to mind, as Serde is pretty cool and I wanted to do argument parsing - which
Clap does better than Python libs I am familiar with.

The software is very minimal. You run it, you get a bunch of lines. You might
have cooler ideas to do with aggregated data (in which case, just take a look at
the parser) or inspect the raw JSON data yourself with `--debug` passed to the
program.

If you would like to see some other features, open either an issue or a pull
request depending on your own ability to implement the changes.
