    <h1>SSA</h1>
    <p align="left">
    Simple, streamlined and ✨ pretty ✨  aggregator for the security report
    generated by <code>systemd-analyze security</code>. Simply collects data
    from JSON output and pretty-prints it for your viewing pleasure.
    Optionally, you can print the results in JSON for easier CI/CD integration.

## Features

- Simple
- Fast (One could say... blazingly fast.)
- Pretty
- Verbose
- Machine & Human friendly
- CI/CD ready

## Usage

SSA can be ran without any arguments, which will return a pretty-printed version
of the security analysis without any kind of sorting or filtering. In addition,
you will be shown the average exposure (between 0.0 and 10.0, 10.0 being most
exposed) and the average happiness (between 0 and 5, 5 being the happiest). In
addition to displaying the top N services for a given predicate, SSA will color
the exposure level output based on how exposed it is. Because here we do things
the _✨ pretty ✨_ way.

The main functionality - the _Crème de la crème_ - of SSA is its ability to
filter services by predicate, and print them in JSON format if need be. If the
default output does not suit your needs, the output of SSA can be spiced up with
additional command-line flags. Possible flags are:

- `-t, --top-n <TOP_N>` -> number of top services to display
- `-p, --predicate <PREDICATE>` -> predicate by which to filter services

- `--safe` -> only return services with the **SAFE** predicate
- `--ok` -> only return services with the **OK** predicate
- `--medium` -> only return services with the **MEDIUM** predicate
- `--exposed` -> only return services with the **EXPOSED** predicate
- `--unsafe` -> only return services with the **UNSAFE** predicate

- `--debug` ->enable debug mode to print the raw JSON output
- `--json` ->output results in JSON format

### Example 1:

One case is that you would combine `--top-n` and `--predicate` to print a number
of services with the predicate you wish to filter for.

```bash
ssa --top-n 10 --predicate UNSAFE
```

This will return the **10** services marked as **UNSAFE** in the security
report. Possible predicates are:

- `SAFE`
- `OK`
- `MEDIUM`
- `EXPOSED`
- `UNSAFE`

### Example 2:

Another case is that you wish to see all **UNSAFE** (scary) services on your
system, for future hardening. In that case you can simply run

```bash
ssa --unsafe
```

This will return all unsafe services. Similarly, you can filter only services
with **OK** predicate if you wish to feel more comfortable.

```bash
ssa --unsafe
```

Better yet, lets show just the _top 3_ services with **MEDIUM** predicate...

```bash
ssa --unsafe --top-n 3
```

## Why?

For what it's worth, SSA has been created because I wanted to write a structured
bash script for parsing the output of `systemd-analyze security`, which actually
does _not_ have any kind of sorting options..

Rust came to mind, as Serde is pretty cool and I wanted to do argument parsing -
which Clap does better than Python libs I am familiar with.

Long story short is that I wanted to aggregate the results of
`systemd-analyze security` for testing and NixOS VM tests in CI. It also acts as
a short-hand alias for `systemd-analyze security` with much better filtering
options.

The software is very minimal. You run it, you get a bunch of lines. You might
have cooler ideas to do with aggregated data (in which case, just take a look at
the parser) or inspect the raw JSON data yourself with `--debug` passed to the
program.

If you would like to see some other features, open either an issue or a pull
request depending on your own ability to implement the changes. SSA is not
restricted by petty limitations such as my other toy project, [Microfetch], and
is always open to new features.
